## PapelesPorfavor
PapelesPorfavor is a Computer Vision Project made by Victor Perez Armenta

This project is based on the famous game called [Papers please](https://papersplea.se/).
The main tools which are going to be used are: [OCR pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract)

# Purpose
Firstly, its main purpose is going to be to recognise failures in passports, like name, country, etc.
I would like to implement something about facial recognition too, but I will go for it just if I get the time.

#Language 
Python will be the main programming language in this project.

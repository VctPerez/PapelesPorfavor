# PapelesPorfavor
PapelesPorfavor is a Computer Vision Project made by Victor Perez Armenta

This project is based on the famous game called [Papers please](https://papersplea.se/).
The main tools which are going to be used are: [OCR pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract), 
[Face-Recognition](https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org), and
[PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5)

## Purpose
Firstly, its main purpose is going to be to recognise failures in passports, like name, country, etc.
I would like to implement something about facial recognition too, but I will go for it just if I get the time (I could).

## Language 
Python will be the main programming language in this project.

## How it works?
The app gives you two options: create a passport or submit it.
* Create a Passport: You have to introduce all the data the app asks you to. Then, you can save the passport, 
or reset it 
* Submit a Passport: You will have to choose the passport you want to use, and answer the questions proposed. When 
you have answered the questions and chose the passport, the app will check if it's okay (it will check your photo, 
your name, etc...)
